# 🧠 human_tree_car_classifier

This project is a deep learning-based image classification tool that detects and classifies objects into three categories: **human**, **tree**, and **car**. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on labeled image data and can predict the class of new images using a saved `.h5` model file.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Multi-class classification**: Human, Tree, Car
- **Custom CNN** built with TensorFlow/Keras
- **Real-time or batch prediction** using Python scripts
- **Modular structure** for classification, feature extraction, and prediction
